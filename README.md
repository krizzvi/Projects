This project implements a singly linked list in Python, featuring basic operations such as adding nodes at the head or a specific position, deleting nodes, reversing the list, and printing its contents. The `Node` class represents individual elements, while the `LinkedList` class handles the structure and operations of the list, maintaining the head, tail, and size. Key methods include `add`, `delete`, `reverse`, and `print_list`, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the linked list with proper handling of edge cases like updating the head, tail, and handling empty lists.
